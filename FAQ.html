            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Absolutely! Dental anxiety is a common problem for patients of all ages and walks of life. In fact almost 40% of people have some form of dental anxiety.
                     We go above and beyond to help you feel comfortable and cared for before, during, and after your appointment.
                      Our staff is compassionate, warm, and dedicated to prioritizing the experience of our patients.
                    We provide state-of-the-art procedures and are always transparent and thoughtful with our patients. 
                    We also offer soothing amenities including essential oils, warm compresses, and more to provide a relaxing environment.

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    Yes! Our wait times usually clock in at around five minutes because we want to make the check-in process as
                     easy and stress-free as possible. At our office, you can use one of our iPads in the waiting room to check in 
                     and fill
                     out patient forms before your appointment or 
                    complete it all on your phone prior to your arrival.

            <div class="content">
                <p>
                    We do. In addition to our comprehensive range of general and cosmetic dental services, 
                    we also perform surgical procedures when necessary. These include: implants, tooth extractions, 
                    root canals, bone grafts, implant-supported dentures, and dental bridges. We aim to provide
                     a comfortable, pain-free experience and great, long-lasting results whenever you require 
                     a surgical procedure.

                <p>
                    We highly recommend that you visit Village Dental every 6 months for routine cleanings and exams.
                    
                    These routine visits will help us catch issues as soon as they begin to develop so we can treat the issue and keep your mouth healthy.
                     In addition, any time you experience pain or discomfort related to your teeth, gums, jaw, or mouth, we recommend making an appointment as soon as possible.

                    At Smile Essence Clinic, we’re always transparent about how much specific treatments and procedures cost. 
                    We always recommend that you meet with our doctors, who will listen to your concerns, answer your questions, 
                    and provide you with a detailed treatment plan with options for you to consider. 
                    This allows you to make the best decision depending on your situation and your budget and financing options

                    Absolutely! We believe everyone deserves high-quality dental care regardless of whether or not they have dental insurance or their financial situation.
                     We welcome both insured and uninsured patients.
                    We are primarily an out-of-network or “fee-for-service” dental-care provider. This allows us to charge a fair, 
                    fixed rate for procedures rather than having to apply extra fees required by third-party insurance companies. Whatever your situation and budget,
                     we’re dedicated to providing you with straightforward estimates and helping you navigate any financial obstacles you may be facing

                     we take a look at your child’s teeth and work to give them a positive experience and introduce them 
                     to the importance of dental care.
